<h1>Gravity Grappler</h1>
<p>Take the helm in Gravity Grappler, a challenging physics-based arcade game inspired by the ambition and peril of the Space Race!</p>
<p>Experience gameplay reminiscent of classic lunar landers, but with a twist. Your journey begins on Earth, where you'll pilot a powerful two-stage rocket. First, master the launch sequence to break free from Earth's formidable gravity. Then, carefully manage your second stage's limited fuel to navigate the void and achieve a soft touchdown anywhere on the surface of the first planet.</p>
<p>But the mission doesn't end there! From that precarious foothold, you'll launch again, pushing deeper into the solar system, hopping from one celestial body to the next. Each planet presents unique gravitational challenges.</p>
<p>Your goal is simple: survive. Keep landing successfully. A crash landing, or drifting helplessly off-screen into the endless dark, means mission failure. Aim for the high score!</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p><b>Objective:</b> Launch from your current location, navigate space, and land safely anywhere on the surface of the next planet.</p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Boost/Thrust:</b> Spacebar / Up Arrow / W</li>
    <li><b>Rotate Left:</b> Left Arrow / A</li>
    <li><b>Rotate Right:</b> Right Arrow / D</li>
    <li><b>Safe Landing:</b> To land without crashing, your downward speed must be less than 5 m/s upon contact with the planet's surface. Use your thrusters carefully to control your descent!</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch Your Fuel! Thrust consumes fuel, and fuel is limited. Use short, controlled bursts for efficient maneuvering. Precision is key!</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>When your mission eventually ends, your performance will be calculated based on several factors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Highest Planet Reached:</b> The further you travel, the more points you earn, with later planets granting significantly more points!</li>
    <li><b>Survival Time:</b> Every second you survive adds to your score.</li>
    <li><b>Booster Recovery:</b> Successfully landing your first-stage booster back on Earth after the initial launch provides a substantial score bonus.</li>
    <li><b>Difficulty Level:</b> Playing on 'Hard' mode provides a significant multiplier to your final score, rewarding those who seek the ultimate challenge.</li>
</ul>
